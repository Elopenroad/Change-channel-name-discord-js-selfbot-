# Change-channel-name-discord-js-selfbot-


well well well.

it's working with **"discord.js-selfbot-v13"** so it's claer that you need to install it first 
```npm i discord.js-selfbot-v13```

now it's time to put your server id known as guild id in the ```guildId``` variable at line "8"

do the same for channels get the channel ids and put them inside ```channelIDs```

# you must know that it would be working for channel with this style : "ðŸ¥œâœ§example" and if you want another style you must change the code.
# make sure that the token you're using has sufficient permission for **---editing channals name---**

-finally you can run the code ```node index.js```
